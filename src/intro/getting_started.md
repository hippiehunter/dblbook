## Getting Started

Let’s start your DBL journey! There’s a lot to learn, but every journey starts
somewhere. In this chapter, we’ll discuss:

* Installing Synergy/DE (the DBL development tools) on Windows
* Writing a program that prints `Hello World`
* Using `msbuild`, the build system for .NET and Traditional DBL applications `**Not sure about the last bit. MSbuild is the build system when using VS or the .NET CLI, but only then. So we need to expand on this, qualify it, or something, but I'm not sure what it should be. maybe it will be obvious when I've red the discussion.`
