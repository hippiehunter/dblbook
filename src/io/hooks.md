# Hooks
IOHooks in DBL provide a powerful mechanism for intercepting and customizing file I/O operations, allowing developers to inject custom logic into the lifecycle of data access without altering existing code. This capability is especially useful in scenarios where you need to add functionality like logging, data validation, transformation, or encryption transparently to the I/O process. By leveraging IOHooks, developers can gain finer control over how their applications interact with data sources, enhancing flexibility, maintainability, and the potential for sophisticated data handling strategies. This feature is invaluable in both developing new applications and enhancing existing ones, as it enables a seamless integration of custom I/O behaviors.

## Utilizing IOHooks

To demonstrate the power and flexibility of IOHooks in DBL, consider a scenario where you need to add logging for every read operation on a file. Instead of modifying every instance where a read operation occurs, you can create a custom IOHooks class that overrides the `read_pre_operation_hook` and `read_post_operation_hook` methods.

### Implementing Read Operation Logging

First, define a class that extends the `IOHooks` class:

```dbl
import Synergex.SynergyDE.IOHooks

namespace Example
    class LoggingIOHooks inherits IOHooks
        public method LoggingIOHooks
            ch, int
            parent(ch)
        proc
        endmethod

        protected method read_pre_operation_hook, void
            in flags, IOFlags
        proc
            ; Custom logic before a read operation
            Console.WriteLine("Pre-read hook: Starting read operation.")
        endmethod

        protected method read_post_operation_hook, void
            inout buffer, a
            in flags, IOFlags
            inout error, int
        proc
            ; Custom logic after a read operation
            Console.WriteLine("Post-read hook: Read operation completed.")
        endmethod
    endclass
endnamespace
```

In this class, `read_pre_operation_hook` is executed before any read operation, and `read_post_operation_hook` is executed after. Both methods log messages to the console.

To use this custom IOHooks class, create an instance and associate it with a file channel:

```dbl
main
record
    channel, int
record rec
    somedata, a100
proc
    open(channel=0, i:i, "mydatafile.ism")
    new BufferedLoggingIOHooks(channel)
    
    ; Perform read operations as usual
    reads(channel, rec)
    ; The hooks will automatically log messages before and after the read

    close channel
    channel = 0
end
```

When the `reads` statement is executed, the pre- and post-read hooks are automatically called, adding logging without changing the original read operation.

### Global IO Hooks for easier adoption

For an application that wasnt designed with a single routine for all file opens, consider using global I/O hooks. Inside the global hook, you get enough information to decide if you want to hook the file and potentially which hook if you have multiple. To implement global hooks, you need to define them in the `SYN_GLOBALHOOKS_OPEN` routine:

```dbl
subroutine SYN_GLOBALHOOKS_OPEN
    in channel, n
    in modes, OPModes
    in filename, a 
proc
    if(filename == "mydatafile") then
        new LoggingIOHooks(channel)
    else
        nop ; Do nothing its not our file
endsubroutine
```

In this example, after each file is opened, the global hook activates, and the logging functionality is applied to all read operations across the application.

### Pitfalls of IOHooks

IOHooks in DBL, while powerful, execute synchronously with I/O operations. This synchronous execution means that the custom logic in the hooks runs in the same thread and directly affects the performance and behavior of the I/O operation. Misusing IOHooks can lead to several detrimental effects on an application, such as performance degradation, data inconsistency, or unintended side-effects.

### Performance Impact

Consider a scenario where you have implemented a `read_post_operation_hook` to perform complex data processing or external API calls:

```dbl
namespace Example
    class HeavyProcessingIOHooks inherits IOHooks
        public method HeavyProcessingIOHooks
            ch, int
            parent(ch)
        proc

        endmethod

        protected method read_post_operation_hook, void
            inout buffer, a
            in flags, IOFlags
            inout error, int
        proc
            ; Complex data processing
            ; or time-consuming external API call
            ;PerformComplexDataProcessing(buffer)
        endmethod
    endclass
endnamespace
```

Using this IOHook, every read operation on the file waits for the `PerformComplexDataProcessing` method to complete. This can significantly slow down the overall performance of your application, especially if there are a lot of records that need to be read in this file.

### Mitigating Performance Impacts in IOHooks

The use of IOHooks, particularly for recording operations, can have a noticeable impact on application performance. Since IOHooks methods are invoked synchronously with I/O operations, any additional processing time they introduce directly affects the overall I/O performance. To mitigate these impacts, it's crucial to optimize the hook methods and consider asynchronous or lightweight logging strategies.

**Use Lightweight Logging** Opt for minimalistic logging formats and avoid complex string operations. For instance, record only essential details such as operation type, timestamp, and identifiers.

**Buffered Logging** Instead of writing logs to a file or external system directly within the hook, consider buffering these logs in memory and writing them in batches. If your scenario allows for the potential buffering delay, this reduces the I/O overhead within the hook.

  ```dbl
import System.Collections
import Synergex.SynergyDE.IOExtensions

namespace Example
    class BufferedLoggingIOHooks inherits IOHooks
        private const BUFFER_THRESHOLD, int, 100
        protected logBuffer, @ArrayList
        ; Other hook methods

        public method BufferedLoggingIOHooks
            ch, int
            parent(ch)
        proc

        endmethod

        protected method write_post_operation_hook, void
            inout buffer, a
            in flags, IOFlags
            inout error, int
        proc
            ; Append log to buffer
            logBuffer.Add(BuildLogEntry(buffer))
            ; Periodically flush the buffer
            if logBuffer.Count >= BUFFER_THRESHOLD then
                FlushLogBuffer()
        endmethod

        private method BuildLogEntry, @a
            buffer, a
        proc
            ;;format the log entry here and return it
            mreturn (@a)buffer
        endmethod

        private method FlushLogBuffer, void
        proc
            ;;write out all of the entries from logBuffer and clear it
        endmethod

    endclass
endnamespace
  ```

**Offload to External processes** Consider delegating the heavy lifting or external network operations to a separate, asynchronous process or thread. This way, the main I/O operations aren't blocked by logging activities.

**Selective Hooking** Be selective about which operations to hook. Not all I/O operations might need logging or additional processing. Consider hooking only the operations that require it.

**Implement Caching** If your hooks involve data lookup or processing that can be cached, implement a caching mechanism to avoid redundant operations. For example, cache the results of database lookups or complex calculations.

**Keep It Simple** The logic within each hook method should be as simple and efficient as possible. Avoid unnecessary computations or complex logic within the hooks.
