# Introduction

Welcome to The DBL Programming Language, an introductory book about DBL. DBL, as a progression of DIBOL, brings together a rich history of business-oriented design with modern software development practices. The DBL programming language empowers you to create efficient, robust software that's both highly portable and backward compatible.

In programming language design, the balance between business functionality and modern programming paradigms is often hard to achieve; DBL confronts this challenge. By integrating procedural syntax reminiscent of its DIBOL roots with contemporary features like object-oriented programming, DBL allows you to manage complex business logic with ease.

What's more, DBL’s extensive support for various file access methods and data types makes it an excellent choice for data-intensive applications. With DBL, you gain control over intricate details without the complexity typically associated with such precision. This gives you the power to focus on what matters most: building reliable, cross-platform business software.

## Naming
In your journey through DBL, you'll encounter several names for this programming language and its associated tools. This diversity of terminology is an unfortunate side effect of its longevity. Originating from DIBOL, DBL has grown and adapted to accommodate various runtimes and environments.

One crucial aspect of DBL is its standalone runtime, often referred to as Traditional Synergy or Traditional DBL. This standalone variant serves as a comprehensive environment for executing DBL applications independently. The robustness and platform independence offered by Traditional DBL allow for efficient and reliable operation of DBL software written 40 years ago.

Further enhancing DBL's versatility is its ability to compile natively to .NET. This integration, frequently referred to as Synergy.NET or DBL running on .NET, permits seamless interaction with .NET framework and services. This adaptability ensures that DBL applications can leverage the power and scope of .NET's extensive libraries and tools.

Whether you're using DBL in its traditional form or harnessing the power of .NET, the essence of DBL remains consistent - offering robust features and superior reliability for diverse programming tasks. The different names of DBL merely reflect its multifaceted nature and ability to operate in varied environments.

## Who This Book Is For

This book assumes that you’ve written code in another programming language but
doesn’t make any assumptions about which one. We’ve tried to make the material
broadly accessible to those from a wide variety of programming backgrounds. We
don’t spend a lot of time talking about what programming *is* or how to think
about it. If you’re entirely new to programming, you would be better served by
reading a book that specifically provides an introduction to programming.

## How to Use This Book

In general, this book assumes that you’re reading it in sequence from front to
back. Later chapters build on concepts in earlier chapters, and earlier
chapters might not delve into details on a particular topic but will revisit
the topic in a later chapter.

## Special Thanks

This book is inspired by, generally structured as and sometimes copied from the [Rust Book](https://github.com/rust-lang/book)
