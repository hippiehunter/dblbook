# Introduction

Welcome to The DBL Programming Language, an introductory book about DBL. DBL, as a progression of DIBOL, brings together a rich history of business-oriented design with modern software development practices. The DBL programming language empowers you to create efficient, robust software that's both highly portable and backward compatible.

In programming language design, the balance between business functionality and modern programming paradigms is often hard to achieve; DBL confronts this challenge. By integrating procedural syntax reminiscent of its DIBOL roots with contemporary features like object-oriented programming, DBL allows you to manage complex business logic with ease.

What's more, DBL’s extensive support for various file access methods and data types makes it an excellent choice for data-intensive applications. With DBL, you gain control over intricate details without the complexity typically associated with such precision. This gives you the power to focus on what matters most: building reliable, cross-platform business software.

## Who This Book Is For

This book assumes that you’ve written code in another programming language but
doesn’t make any assumptions about which one. We’ve tried to make the material
broadly accessible to those from a wide variety of programming backgrounds. We
don’t spend a lot of time talking about what programming *is* or how to think
about it. If you’re entirely new to programming, you would be better served by
reading a book that specifically provides an introduction to programming.

## How to Use This Book

In general, this book assumes that you’re reading it in sequence from front to
back. Later chapters build on concepts in earlier chapters, and earlier
chapters might not delve into details on a particular topic but will revisit
the topic in a later chapter.
