# Fetching Fun: A Simple HTTP Client Project
Now that you have a good understanding of routines, variables, control flow, and strings, let's put them to use in a simple HTTP client project. We'll use this project to explore the HTTP and JSON APIs in DBL. You'll see a few new APIs and some very basic file I/O. We aren't going to go into complete detail on the APIs we use here, but we'll give you enough to get started. You can find more information on the APIs we use in the [Synergy DBL Language Reference](https://www.synergex.com/docs/).<!--Should this link go directly to the LRM instead of the main doc page?-->
