# Complex Types
Data can be broadly categorized into simple types (like integers, booleans, and decimal numbers) and complex types. Complex types, including classes, structures, and interfaces, are present in most modern programming languages. They allow developers to design more human-readable, organized, and modular code by representing more intricate data structures or behaviors.

The very notion of creating complex types stems from the need to manage and abstract the inherent complexity in software systems. By using classes, structures, and interfaces, developers can create modular, reusable components. These components can be pieced together in various configurations to build higher-level functionalities or to represent intricate data models.

The essence of using these complex types lies in their composable nature. As systems grow and requirements evolve, the ability to break down and reconstruct components becomes indispensable. Complex types, designed with composability in mind, provide the building blocks that make such modularity possible, enabling developers to tackle intricate problems with clarity and efficiency.
