# Ranging
In Traditional DBL, you are allowed to reference outside the defined area up to the end of the data area, if your dimension specification is larger than the declared size of its corresponding array dimension, a technique referred to as 'over subscripting', 'subscripting off the end' or 'over ranging'. However, this is not permitted in .NET. In Traditional DBL it is not allowed for class data fields or when '-qstrict' or '-qcheck' is specified. Over subscripting can lead to a significant number of bugs in production. To prevent these, '-qcheck' is recommended for all development environments and '-qstrict' for all production builds.
